  # Calculates the total number of cards needed for the game.

  # Formula:
  #   total_cards = 2 * (points_to_win - 1) + 3 + total_cards_on_board
  #
  # Explanation:
  #   - Both players could be at (points_to_win - 1) before the final turn.
  #   - A player can win with a 3-card match, so add 3 for the final possible match.
  #   - The board must always be full, so add total_cards_on_board.
  #
  # This ensures the board is always full, even if the last match is a 3-card match.
